## Note to Students

### Optional External Activity

I’m happy to support a voluntary, student-run **Brand Management Club**.  

A few clarifications to avoid any misunderstanding:

- The club is **independent of PES University**.  
- I participate **only as a mentor in my personal capacity**, and/or as an employee of **Qwykr Technologies**'s non-profit arm, not as a representative of the university.  
- The initiative operates under **Delphic Ventures (USA)** as a social-impact project. It is **not commercial** and involves **no financial transactions**.  Qwykr Technologies is a division of Delphic Ventures.
- Participation is **100% optional**, has **no impact on grades**, and is unrelated to any course requirements.  
- You are free to join, not join, or leave at any time with no academic implications.

If you’re interested in exploring real-world brand-building concepts in an informal setting, you’re welcome to participate.
