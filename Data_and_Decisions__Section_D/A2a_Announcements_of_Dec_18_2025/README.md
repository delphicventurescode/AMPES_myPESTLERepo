## 📝 Summary: Virtual Machines and Programming Resources

Hi everyone,

This post summarizes the key resources and technical guidance shared recently.

**VirtualBox Setup:** When creating Linux VMs (Mint, Ubuntu, Fedora, Manjaro, etc.), select the appropriate **Linux Type** and the closest **Version** available (e.g., use 'Ubuntu' or 'Debian' for Mint; use 'Arch Linux' for Manjaro) to optimize your settings. Make sure to pick a good Linux distro.

**Programming Resource:** An optional sample HTML code repository is available on GitHub for those interested in programming. The repository is private, so **please email me** to request access if you wish to explore it. All this material is purely for supplemental learning outside of the main course curriculum.
