### Announcements (Nov 28, 2025)

1. **ISA #1** is scheduled for the week of **Dec 22**. (please double check the dates). Please be prepared.

2. Please keep up with the textbook. The slide decks for the class go in parallel with the textbook. In my Section C class, I ask students to keep up with the textbook as particular sections get covered in the slide deck.
   Please follow the same general logic in this class also.
