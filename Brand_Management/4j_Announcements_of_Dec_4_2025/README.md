# 💎 Kapferer’s Brand Identity Prism

Kapferer’s Brand Identity Prism is a framework that helps marketers define and express a brand’s identity in a clear, multidimensional way. It argues that a strong brand is built not just through what it sells, but through how it **looks, behaves, communicates, and is perceived by consumers**.

The prism includes six interconnected facets that together form a complete picture of the brand.

## 🌍 External Expression (The Brand's Sender)

The first three facets describe the **external expression** of the brand:

| Facet | Description | Example Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Physique** | The brand’s tangible features — its visual symbols, product design, packaging, and sensory cues. | Logo, product shape, color palette. |
| **2. Personality** | Describes the brand’s character, often expressed through tone of voice, communication style, and human traits. | Is the brand "adventurous," "reliable," or "witty"? |
| **3. Culture** | Represents the brand’s values, heritage, and guiding principles, shaping how it behaves internally and externally. | Origin, mission, ethical stances. |

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Consumer Relationship (The Brand's Receiver)

The remaining three facets focus on the **consumer relationship** and internal perception:

| Facet | Description | Example Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4. Relationship** | Captures how the brand interacts with customers and the type of relationship it promises — whether it’s friendly, authoritative, helpful, or aspirational. | Customer service style, loyalty programs. |
| **5. Reflection** | Describes how the brand sees its **typical customer**; it’s not who the customer actually is, but who the brand *imagines* as its ideal user. | The demographic/lifestyle portrayed in advertising. |
| **6. Self-Image** | Refers to how customers **see themselves** when they use the brand — the internal mirror that shapes identity and loyalty. | How using the product makes the consumer feel (e.g., successful, cool, responsible). |

---

Together, these six facets create a coherent identity that guides branding decisions, communication strategies, product design, and customer experience. By using the Brand Identity Prism, companies can ensure their messaging is **consistent, authentic, and emotionally resonant**, helping them build a strong, differentiated presence in a crowded marketplace.
