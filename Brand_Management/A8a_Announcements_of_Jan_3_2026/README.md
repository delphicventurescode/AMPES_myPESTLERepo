# Class Announcement: Brand Management Club Meeting

Dear Class,

The **Brand Management Club** meeting—which also serves as a forum for class-related issues—takes place every **Saturday at 12:00 PM**. We will be meeting today as scheduled.

Please use this session to bring up any of the following:

* **Curriculum Support:** Any content you did not understand and would like to have retaught.
* **Attendance:** Any concerns or issues regarding your attendance record.
* **Presentations:** Requests for a new date if you missed your previously assigned slot.

You can approach the CRs for meeting link, which has also been shared via WhatsApp.

**Important Note on Presentations:** Please be advised that, if you missed giving your presentation on the assigned date, being assigned a new presentation slot, or completing a presentation in a new slot, does not automatically guarantee that points will be awarded. Decisions regarding if and how points are allocated will be based on specific yardsticks and rubrics applied uniformly to all students.

See you all there!

Best regards,  
Anand
