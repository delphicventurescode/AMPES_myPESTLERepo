Dear class,

Here is a question to think about.

Why do users switch from a global powerhouse like Adobe to lightweight, open-source alternatives? Articles on the Internet highlight an interesting shift in consumer preference and brand loyalty in certain demographics towards open source software. Open source systems such as Linux are perfect examples of how "simplicity" can become a core brand promise that resonates with a specific market segment.

A useful article on an open source alternative to Adobe Acrobat is available here: https://www.makeuseof.com/lightweight-open-source-pdf-viewer-better-acrobat/

Check it out, in case this is of interest. #optionalReading
