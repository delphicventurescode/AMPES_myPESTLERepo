Dear class,

Here is a question to think about.

Why do users switch from a global powerhouse like Adobe to a lightweight, open-source alternative? Articles on the Internet highlight an interesting shift in consumer preference and brand loyalty. Open source systems such as *inux are perfect examples of how "simplicity" can become a core brand promise that resonates with a specific market segment.

A useful article on an open source alternative to Adobe Acrobat is available here: https://www.makeuseof.com/lightweight-open-source-pdf-viewer-better-acrobat/

Check it out, in case this is of interest. #optionalReading
