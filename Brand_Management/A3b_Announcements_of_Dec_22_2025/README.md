# README

**New repo for a new year!**

To my Trimester 4 MBA students: 

We are officially transitioning our resources to a new home for 2026: 
**AMPES_myGxojaRepo** [https://github.com/delphicventurescode/AMPES_myGxojaRepo](https://github.com/delphicventurescode/AMPES_myGxojaRepo)

**IMPORTANT:** Because this is a **private repository**, the link above will show a "404 Not Found" error until you are officially added as a collaborator. 

### To gain access, we will do an activity in the class. Let us call it the Access activity.

We will do the Access activity during the class, and it will be as follows.

1. We will circulate a URL in our class at the appropriate time. This might be a Facebook post on a Facebook Page. 

2. You will be told: "Please **comment with your GitHub username below**." 

3. We will be collecting all usernames and adding everyone to the repository in one go.

Nothing for you to do right now, but here is a preview of the Action Items that will be involved for this class activity. 

### [ PREVIEW_BEGIN ]

#### Action Items for the class activity:
1. **Provide your GitHub username:** Drop it in the comments of this post.
2. **Accept the Invitation:** Once we process the list, you will receive an email from GitHub. You **must** click the link in that email to accept the invitation and gain access.
3. **Engage:** Once you are in, please "Watch" and "Star" the repository to stay updated on all developments for the course mini-project.

You will need a GitHub username for this activity. So, please do sign up on GitHub and get a username ahead of the class activity.

### [ PREVIEW_END ]

Let’s start the new year with a **Gxoja** mindset.
