## Notice

I had posted on the class WhatsApp Group a message that included the following.

"Dear class,

I have opened the portal and created two additional items. Both of them have the prefix FINALO. Please upload your RP and your presentations here."

Students who have not yet uploaded their **RP PDFs** and/or **presentation PPTs** to the portal are required to email the class representatives, **cc’ing the instructor**, with the reasons for the delay.

Please address this **immediately**. Students are required to send out the email by EOD today (that is, Monday).
