### **Subject: Update: Brand Management Club Session & Good Luck on Exams!**

Hi everyone,

I recognize that you have exams today, and I want to wish you all the very best of luck.

Regarding the **Brand Management Club session** scheduled for this Saturday: I want to confirm that it will absolutely be held as usual. While I understand that with your exams today, attendance might be low—or perhaps no one will be able to make it—**I will still be there on my side regardless.**

**Meeting Logistics:**
* **Link:** The Google Meet link has already been shared in our **Class WhatsApp Group** (the Fulmo-style WhatsApp Group).
* **Action Item:** Please **bookmark or save this URL** now so you have it easily accessible for today and all future sessions.

Focus on your exams, and for those who can join, I’ll see you there.

Best regards,

[Prof. Anand Manikutty]
