## 🗓️ Important: Rescheduling Brand Management Presentations

Hi everyone,

If you were unable to complete your presentations on your assigned date, please come to the **Brand Management Club meeting** this Saturday at **12:00 PM (noon)** to reschedule. We are meeting online every Saturday at twelve noon for the Brand Management Club.

You can obtain the Google Meet link we use for the club meeting from your  class representatives. The Google Meet link always remains the same.

Handling reschedules this way will significantly help **streamline our operational planning** for the remainder of the course. Please plan to attend if you missed your presentation date.
