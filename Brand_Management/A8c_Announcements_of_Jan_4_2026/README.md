# Announcement: Saturday Office Hours & Meeting Slots

Hi everyone,

I would like to encourage all of you to attend our **Saturday meetings** if you have any questions regarding:

* **Course Content:** Clarifications on lectures, concepts, or academic materials.
* **Class Logistics:** Questions regarding schedules, submissions, or administrative procedures. Also, questions frelated to rescheduling your presentation slots if you missed the original presentation slot, and questions related to attendance.

The Saturday meetings are at twelve noon. To ensure everyone has an opportunity to connect, I opened a **second slot** this past Saturday for those who were unable to make it to the first one. 

I will be offering a **second slot next Saturday** as well. If you would like to know the specific timing for this second session, please **send me an email** to inquire.

Additionally, please note that there are only three more presentation days left with three people scheduled for each day, plus the three people originally scheduled for january 16th now moved to January 9th. If you expect not to be able to make it to your presentation, please make sure to send out an email by EOD Monday.

I look forward to seeing you in class on Tuesday.

Best regards,  
Anand Manikutty
