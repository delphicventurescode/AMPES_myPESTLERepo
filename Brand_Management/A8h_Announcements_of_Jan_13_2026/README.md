Dear Class,

In response to several requests, I am granting a final and only two-day extension for your Research Paper submissions.

The new deadline is January 13 at 12:00 midnight.

Please note that no further extensions will be granted. Appropriate rubrics will be applied, that is, you will, most likely, be assessed a penalty for the late submission.

Best regards,
Anand
