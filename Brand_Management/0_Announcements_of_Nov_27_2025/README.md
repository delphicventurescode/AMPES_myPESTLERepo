This directory contains the announcements for **Nov 27, 2025**.

For today's announcements, just go through this file (that is, this README.md file).

We need to have a dedicated class communication platform, such as **Piazza or Google Classroom**. I am planning to speak with the Dean to request that one of these software platforms be made officially available for our classes.

Until then, we will be using this GitHub repo. I am also exploring other options.

Please make sure to send your PPT slide decks by EOD the day before the presentation.
