## Sample HTML Code Repository

Hi everyone,

For those of you who expressed an interest in learning a bit of programming, I’ve created a small GitHub repository with some sample HTML code that you can explore and experiment with.

You can find it here:  
**https://github.com/delphicventurescode/SAMPHT1_sample_html_repo__priv/tree/main/html**

It is currently private. I will give access to those people who are interested in learning programming. Just send me email if you are interested.

Feel free to browse through the files, modify them on your own machine, and try things out.

As a reminder, please continue keeping up with the textbook. The topics we cover in class follow the course slide deck closely, and the slides themselves parallel the structure of the textbook. Reading both together will make the concepts much clearer.

Let me know via email if you have any questions. So far, every single question sent to me via email has been answered.
