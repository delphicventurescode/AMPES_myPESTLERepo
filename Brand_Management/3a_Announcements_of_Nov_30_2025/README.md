Dear Class,

A few comments:

1. Students are expected to begin using the GitHub website and, later in the trimester, possibly the Sentimento web app. All announcements will be posted on GitHub.

2. If you have any questions about how GitHub works, or Sentimento works, please reach out to your Class Reps.

3. You just need to know how to create an account on GitHub.com and access a repository. It is no different from creating an account on Amazon.com or Flipkart.com, and then going to a specific URL.
