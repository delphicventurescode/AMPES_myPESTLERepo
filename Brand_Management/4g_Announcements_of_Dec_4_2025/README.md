## 💡 What is Adobe Firefly?

Adobe Firefly is a **generative AI platform** created by Adobe to produce high-quality visual content — including images, graphics, text effects, and design elements — using simple natural-language prompts.

It is built directly into Adobe tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Express, allowing users to **instantly generate or modify visuals** within their existing workflows.

* **Generative fill & editing**, letting users add, remove, or transform objects in photos with realistic results.

## ✅ Strengths / ❌ Weaknesses

| Category | Strengths | Weaknesses / Limitations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Workflow** | Deep integration with Creative Cloud tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Express). | Still developing compared to some highly specialized, niche AI art tools. |
| **Output** | High-quality, brand-consistent visual output using features like Style Kits and Custom Models. | Requires an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, which may be costly for casual users. |
| **Usability** | Intuitive for non-designers due to prompt-based workflows. | AI output, while high-quality, may still need human review and refinement. |
