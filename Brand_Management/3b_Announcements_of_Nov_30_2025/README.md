Dear Class,

Please go through all the material in the Unit 2 slide deck before Tuesday’s session (this is mandatory). Additionally, please review the Unit 1 material in the textbook before class, if possible.

A reminder that your first ISA is only a few days away. I have already emphasized the importance of reading the textbook to stay on track with the course. It is your responsibility to plan your reading so that you are fully prepared for ISA 1. 

Please go everything in the textbook for Unit 1 and Unit 2 to prepare for the ISAs. Those are the portions that will be tested on ISA1.
