## 🧠 The Science of "Flow"
Drawing from psychologist **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**, Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that our conscious capacity to process information is limited to approximately **120 bits per second**.

* **The Cause of Distraction:** Listening to one person takes roughly 60 bits. If you only commit 40 bits to a task, the remaining 80 bits of "surplus capacity" will naturally seek out distractions (phone, stray thoughts, etc.).
* **The Flow State:** Focus occurs when you pour nearly all of your 120-bit capacity into a single object, leaving no room for the mind to wander.

## ⚖️ The Balance: Skill vs. Challenge
Concentration is maintained by balancing your **Skill Level** (X-axis) against the **Challenge Level** (Y-axis):

| State | Condition | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anxiety** | Challenge is higher than Skill | Break the task into smaller, easier pieces. |
| **Boredom** | Skill is higher than Challenge | Increase the difficulty or use "active" methods. |
| **Flow** | Skill and Challenge are matched | Maintain this state to stay focused and happy. |
