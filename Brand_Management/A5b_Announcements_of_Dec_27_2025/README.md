# Brand Management Perspective: Authenticity vs. AI Hype

I recently came across a sharp critique of the software industry on LinkedIn. The author pointed out that the "over-the-top self-promotion" surrounding LLMs often ignores the high energy costs, the impact on human cognition, and the actual quality of the end product. Their conclusion? They’d rather leave the hype behind and "go find their horse."

This strikes a chord with what we are studying in Brand Management: **How do you position a brand in a saturated, hype-driven market?**

### The Better Philosophy: Transparent Value

At **Qwykr Technologies**, and **Fulmo Technologies**, we take a "efikeco" (trans. "efficiency") based approach. While our software is powered by AI and advanced tech, you won't see us making the kind of "over-the-top" claims that have become common in the industry. 

Instead of selling the *technology*, we focus on the *utility*. Our goal is to ensure that the tech remains transparent so the user can focus on what matters. You’ll see this reflected in:

* **Ease of management** for classrooms.
* **Seamless coordination** for the Brand Management club.
* **Clarifying and simplifying** complex classroom logistics.

Yes, this is all enabled by Qwykr’s tech, but we believe the best brand experience is one where the technology doesn't get in the way. It happens behind the scenes, allowing the results to speak for themselves.

In a world trying to "cash in on the hype," we’re focusing on building long-term brand equity through reliability and clarity.

This is something worth thinking about but for now, we will negotiate the A.I. while leaving you to negotiate the exams. :-) 

Bonŝancon por la ekzameno. (trans. : "Good luck for the examination").
