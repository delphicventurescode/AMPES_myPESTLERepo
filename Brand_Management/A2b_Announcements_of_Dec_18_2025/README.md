**Reminder:** There *will* be class tomorrow (Friday, December 19, 2025).

If I were unable to attend due to illness or any other unforeseen circumstance, an update would be posted on this GitHub repository. In my professional practice, even when a meeting needs to be rescheduled, at least three days’ advance notice is the norm. I have followed this standard consistently for over five years and have never failed to notify stakeholders with sufficient notice.

I would also like to reiterate the importance of using the **correct subject line** when notifying me about missing or incorrect attendance records.

Please see below for the previously sent communication.

If you have any days on which you are missing attendance because you have been incorrectly marked as being absent, please let me know what dates you are missing and use the following subject as the subject of your email:

"BRAND MANAGEMENT : MISSING ATTENDANCE"

(no quotes).

Please resend your emails with this subject even if you have already notified via email. Make sure to indicate what dates you are missing for attendance.
