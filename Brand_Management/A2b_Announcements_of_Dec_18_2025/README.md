Reminder: yes, there will be a class tomorrow (that is, Friday, December 19, 2025). 

If there were any issues with my being unable to attend due to illness, I would have posted an update on this GitHub repo. At my company, even when a meeting date needs to be changed, we almost always provide at least three days' advance notice, and I have consistently followed this practice for over five years. I have never failed to inform stakeholders with sufficient advance notice. 

A separate point I would like to make is concerning using the appropriate subject line when letting me know about any missing attendanace.

Please see below for the previously sent communication.

If you have any days on which you are missing attendance because you have been incorrectly marked as being absent, please let me know what dates you are missing and use the following subject as the subject of your email:

"BRAND MANAGEMENT : MISSING ATTENDANCE"

(no quotes).

[+]

Please resend your emails with this subject even if you have already notified via email. Make sure to indicate what dates you are missing for attendance.
