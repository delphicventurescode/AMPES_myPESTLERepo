The preferred times for students in both classes (both "Data and Decisions" and "Brand Management) to contact me via email are the following:

- on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesday: between 9:00 am and 1:30 pm.
- on Thursday and Fridays: between 7:00 am and 11:30 am.

[+]

You can email me at other times also, but these are the preferred times for you to email me.

If you have questions you have not been able to have answered via email, please have them answered in person.

You can use the Brand Management Club meetings to have questions answered in case you are unable to make it a class and still need to have questions answered.

[+]

The Brand Management Club meetings are at twelve noon on Saturdays.
