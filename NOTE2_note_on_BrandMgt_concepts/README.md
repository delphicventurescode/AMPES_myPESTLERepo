# Brand Management Concepts: Key Ideas Every Marketer Should Know

As part of our ongoing learning series, here are five essential Brand Management concepts that shape how brands are built and sustained.

## 1. Brand Positioning
Brand positioning refers to how a brand is placed in the minds of consumers relative to competitors. Good positioning defines the target customer, the category of competition, and the unique value the brand offers. Clear positioning helps ensure that all communication stays consistent.

## 2. Brand Equity
Brand equity is the value a brand adds beyond just the functional product. It includes awareness, perceived quality, associations, emotional connection, and customer loyalty. Strong brand equity allows a brand to charge premium prices and expand more easily into new markets.

## 3. Brand Architecture
Brand architecture is the way brands, sub-brands, and product lines are organized within a company. Examples include a “branded house” (such as Google and its services), a “house of brands” (such as P&G with Tide, Pampers, etc.), or a hybrid structure. Good architecture avoids confusion and supports strategic growth.

## 4. Brand Identity vs Brand Image
Brand identity is what the company intends to communicate through its name, logo, tone, values, and promise. Brand image is what consumers actually perceive based on their interactions and experiences. Strong brand management aligns identity and image as closely as possible.

## 5. Customer-Based Brand Equity (Keller’s Model)
Keller’s model explains how strong brands are built in four steps:

- Brand salience (awareness)  
- Brand performance and imagery (functional and emotional associations)  
- Brand judgments and feelings (consumer evaluations and reactions)  
- Brand resonance (deep loyalty and active engagement)

This model helps managers diagnose brand strength and plan long-term strategy.
