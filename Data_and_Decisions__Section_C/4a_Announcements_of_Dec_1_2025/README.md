Dear Class,

I am assigning you all a new homework task, which will be called the “Essay Homework.”

Please write a three-page essay applying the concepts of probability and statistics that we have learned in class so far. You may choose any topic of interest, including politics, the arts, music, health (such as COVID), or sports (such as the Indian cricket team or Royal Challengers Bangalore).

A quick note of feedback: many of you are not keeping up with the assigned readings, particularly the textbook material corresponding to the slides in Units 1 and 2. Please make sure you stay up to date with the readings.

Thanks!
