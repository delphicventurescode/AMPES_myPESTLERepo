## 📢 Important: Virtual Machine Setup & HTML Code Resources

Hi everyone,

I'm providing two separate pieces of information that may be helpful for your technical and class-related work:

---

### 💻 1. Oracle VirtualBox Setup Guidance

For those of you setting up Oracle VirtualBox environments, here are the recommended settings when creating a new Linux Guest OS, like Linux Mint or Ubuntu:

| Operating System | Field in VirtualBox | Recommended Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linux Mint** | Type: | **Linux** |
| | Version: | **Ubuntu (64-bit)** or **Debian (64-bit)** |
| **Ubuntu** | Type: | **Linux** |
| | Version: | **Ubuntu (64-bit)** (or the specific bit version you downloaded) |

*The "OS Distribution" is usually covered by the "Version" selection in the setup wizard.*

### 🌐 2. Sample HTML Code Repository (Programming Resource)

For those of you in the **Data and Decisions** class (as well as the Brand Management class) who expressed an interest in learning a bit of programming, I’ve created a small GitHub repository with some sample HTML code that you can explore and experiment with.

**Repository Link:**
`https://github.com/delphicventurescode/SAMPHT1_sample_html_repo__priv/tree/main/html`

**Important:**
The repository is currently **private**. I will give access to those people who are interested in learning programming. **Please send me an email if you are interested** in gaining access.

Feel free to browse through the files, modify them on your own machine, and try things out.

Let me know via email if you have any questions about either your VM setup or the programming repository. As usual, every single question sent to me via email has been answered.
