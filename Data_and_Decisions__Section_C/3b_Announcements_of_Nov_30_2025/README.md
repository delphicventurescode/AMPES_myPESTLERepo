## 📢 Important: Probability Review Required

To all students who are currently having difficulty in following the course material, I strongly recommend taking the following steps **immediately** to build a solid foundation in probability. Silence will not solve your difficulties—I need to know what you are confused about!

### Your Action Plan

1.  **Watch All Videos:** Go through **as many videos as possible**  in the Khan Academy Probability Library, until you come up to speed. Only you can assess when you have come up to speed.
    * **Link:** [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library)
2.  **Identify Questions:** As you watch, specifically note every concept, formula, or example that you do not fully understand.
3.  **Share Your Questions:** After completing the videos, you **must** share your questions with me, either by:
    * **Emailing me** a list of your specific questions.
    * **Telling me** your questions during our next class session.
    
4. Once you have come up to speed, you can use the MIT course mentioned before to more quickly understand other concepts covered.

5. A quick way to come up to speed is to use the resources provided on this webapge:
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2022/pages/classes-reading-and-in-class-materials/
   
**The expectation is that you will watch the videos and come back prepared with specific questions for discussion.**
