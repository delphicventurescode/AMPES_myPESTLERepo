## 📢 Important: Probability Review Required

To all students who are currently having difficulty in following the course material, I strongly recommend taking the following steps **immediately** to build a solid foundation in probability. Silence will not solve your difficulties—I need to know what you are confused about!

### Your Action Plan

1.  **Watch All Videos:** Go through **every** video in the Khan Academy Probability Library.
    * **Link:** [https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library)
2.  **Identify Questions:** As you watch, specifically note every concept, formula, or example that you do not fully understand.
3.  **Share Your Questions:** After completing the videos, you **must** share your questions with me, either by:
    * **Emailing me** a list of your specific questions.
    * **Telling me** your questions during our next class session.

**The expectation is that you will watch the videos and come back prepared with specific questions for discussion.**
